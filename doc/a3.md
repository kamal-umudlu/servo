# Diagnose

Entering fullscreen mode is passing `None` value to `Window` when `set_fullscreen` function is called which prevents 
Servo actually entering fullscreen mode. 
In addition, the function `exit_fullscreen` in `document.rs` is passing True value to 
`SetFullscreenState` which doesn't allow to exit from fullscreen mode.

# Solution

1. Instead of passing `None` value when `FullScreenState` is true, `window.get_primary_monitor()` is called in order to pass a monitor id.
This fix make Servo actually enter fullscreen mode.
2. Changed `SetFullscreenState` to false when `exit_fullscreen` function is called.
3. In addition, added new implementation to support exiting from fullscreen mode by pressing `Escape` button.

# Testing Plan

After my change in [windows.rs and document.rs](https://github.com/kamal-umudlu/servo/commit/af6b5981541bd407fba8a0e9f4ea1713f7c6e25c),
the Servo app can enter/exit fullscreen mode. 
In addition, the [`ESC button support`](https://github.com/kamal-umudlu/servo/commit/14ebd5bbb055d436a01756fd8fc0a5595e41332e)
allows to exit from fullscreenmode (See the screenshots below).

**After Pressing "Go full screen" button the Servo app swtiches to fullscreen mode**

**By pressing `ESC` button, it exits fullscreen mode** (screenshot 1)
